# Data Science & Spatial Analytics Portfolio

This repository is a personal portfolio showcasing my projects in data analysis, data science, and spatial data science.

The projects are designed to demonstrate practical skills in working with real-world data using modern analytical tools and programming languages.

## About This Repository

This portfolio includes projects developed using:

- Excel for data analysis and dashboarding  
- Python for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and modeling  
- SQL & PostgreSQL for database querying and analytics  
- R for statistical and analytical tasks  
- GIS & spatial analysis tools for spatial data science projects  

Each project focuses on problem-solving, data-driven insights, and reproducible analysis.
